A rulebase for liblognorm
=========================

The aim of this project is to build a rulebase for liblognorm, a normalization
library which is able to parse arbitrary syslog messages and output well-defined
name-value pairs based on predefined rules describing the message format.

Due to the vast amount of syslog message formats, this rulebase is not intended
to be used "as is", but as a starting point for selecting rules needed in a
specific environment or for a specific use-case.

The syntax used in this rulebase requires liblognorm >= 1.0.0
